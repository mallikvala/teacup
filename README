A simple desktop music widget for Android primarily designed to be used with the
stock player.  Shows embedded art (or else any image file in the same directory
as the track file), play, prev, next buttons.  Press album art to open the music
player.

Written and tested for Android 2.3.3 (Android 10) on a Samsung Galaxy Mini 2,
but seems to compile and work in emulators for 4.2 (Android 17).

Hopefully all the files you need to compile are here...

... except a build system...

Linux-wise, you should be able to run

    android update project --path . --target android-10

assuming you've set-up the android-sdk with android-10 (probably compiles for
other targets).  (Run simply "android" to start setting up targets.)

And that will generate build.xml and local.properties, then you should be able
to do

    ant debug

and an .apk will be built and put in bin/.

I've included build.xml.generated and local.properties.generated which are the
files generated on my machine.  Renames to build.xml and local.properties, maybe
they'll work for you (if you edit local properties to tell it where the android
sdk is installed).

For more on building, see here

and here

Then, once it's built, copy the .apk to your phone, open it up and let it
install.  (Or use adb or whatever you prefer.)
