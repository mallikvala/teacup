A simple desktop music widget primarily designed to be used with the stock
player.  Shows embedded art, play, prev, next buttons.  Press album art to open
the music player.

Icons shamelessly stolen from the web.  They're all free for non-commercial use,
but i wasn't careful enough to keep track of where i got them from...

Hopefully all the files you need to compile are here...

... except a build system...

Linux-wise, you should be able to run

    android update project --path . --target android-10

assuming you've set-up the android-sdk with android-10 (probably compiles for
other targets).  (Run simply "android" to start setting up targets.)

And that will generate build.xml and local.properties, then you should be able
to do

    ant debug

and an .apk will be built and put in bin/.

I've included build.xml.generated and local.properties.generated which are the
files generated on my machine.  Renames to build.xml and local.properties, maybe
they'll work for you.
