A simple desktop music widget primarily designed to be used with the stock
player.  Shows embedded art, play, prev, next buttons.  Press album art to open
the music player.

Icons shamelessly stolen from the web.  They're all free for non-commercial use,
but i wasn't careful enough to keep track of where i got them from...

Hopefully all the files you need to compile are here.
